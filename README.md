# 🧠 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) – Session Code

This repository contains code examples and notebooks for each session in the **YouTube RAG Series** where we build a domain-specific Question Answering system using the RAG framework.

## 📌 Series Overview

We use a curated set of **Quantum Computing notes** as the knowledge base and walk through each component of RAG with hands-on examples.
